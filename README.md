# Oscillator Playground

This is not so much a real project as it is place for me to learn about DSP in general and in Rust specifically.

It is not a production audio appliction but I beleive it might prove useful to others.

It will change over time as I add more stuff.

If you are looking to make a serious audio application I suggest you look at some of the great crates that already exist by people that know what 
they are doing already.
