# Oscillator Playground

This is not so much a real project as it is place for me to learn about DSP in general and in Rust specifically.

It is not a production audio application, but I believe it might prove useful to others.

It will change over time as I add more stuff.

If you are looking to make a serious audio application I suggest you look at some of the great crates that already exist by people that know what 
they are doing already.

To use it you can just "cargo run" or "cargo build" and run the binary as usual.  There is a UI now that allows you to start and stop a random 
arpeggiator and choose the notes it will play.
